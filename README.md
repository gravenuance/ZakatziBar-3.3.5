# ZakatziBar
### Imagine a worse version of ebar, tmw, and interrupt bar together in one addon.

Tracks player, party and enemy spells. Tracks specs, and works with Preparation, Cold Snap, and Readiness.

---
Spells are hardcoded, but you can easily acquire their IDs by doing '/zb debug'.

'/zb clear' removes every tracked spell and player.

Location is also hardcoded, just change it in the code and '/reload'.
