A World of Warcraft 3.3.5 addon.

Tracks player, party and hostile spells. Tracks specs, and works with Preparation, Cold Snap, and Readiness.

---
Spells are hardcoded, but you can easily acquire their IDs by doing '/zb debug'.

'/zb clear' removes every tracked spell and player.

Location is also hardcoded, just change it in the code and '/reload'.

TODO:
Incorporate "PARTY_MEMBERS_CHANGED".
Create separate bars for each party member.
Track CDs and specific buffs/debuffs for party members.
Create a border around different spells.
